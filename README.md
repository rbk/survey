# Let's get Technical

This project was created to get an idea of your coding ability. Your submission will be ran in a clean environment and tested for expected output. Please be sure to provide instructions for installing any dependancies. We will be looking at the quality and professionalism of your work. In particular we look for clean, well-designed, maintainable code. Although this is a rather small task, it should be approached as you would an actual task for a customer.

## The Problem
A survey was giving to ~500 people to identify the favorite animal between cats and dogs from a diverse group of people (See [data.txt](data.txt)). The vertical bar delimited file contains the age, gender, and favorite animal of each entry.

## The Solution
This data needs to be parsed to the expected output (See [output.json](output.json)) 

## The Rules
This should be implemented in a language with which you are familiar. We would prefer that you use javascript or php, if you are comfortable doing so. If none of these are comfortable, please choose a language that is both comfortable for you and suited to the task. Add a `src` folder with your code and `dist` folder with your output.json file. 

We appreciate well factored, object-oriented or functional designs.
Please document your code using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/)
